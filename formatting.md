Plain text posts are boring! Don't you think so? This is why we give you some formatting options right from the beginning. BehindCoffee uses modified [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for formatting. Learn the basics by following some of the formatting options detailed below.

| What you type | What you get |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| `*This text is in italic*`      | *This text is in italic*     |
| `**This text is bold**`      | **This text is bold**     |
| `[BehindCoffee](http://behindcoffee.com)` | [BehindCoffee](http://behindcoffee.com) |
| `* List Item 1`<br />`* List Item 2` | <ul><li>List Item 1</li><li>List Item 2</li></ul> |
| `> Quote`       | <quote>Quote</quote>       |
