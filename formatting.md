Plain text posts are boring! Don't you think so? This is why we give you some formatting options right from the beginning. BehindCoffee uses modified [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for formatting. Learn the basics by following some of the formatting options detailed below.

| What you type | What you get |
